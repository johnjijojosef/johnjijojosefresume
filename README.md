## üìÇ Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file with all styles, including responsive layout and dark mode styling.
- `scripts.js`: JavaScript file for theme toggling, form handling, animations, and interactivity.
- `packages/`: Folder containing images, icons, and other assets used throughout the site.

## Email Functionality

- **Integrated with [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/):** Allows users to send messages directly from the contact form without requiring a backend server.
- **Dynamic Template Parameters:**
  - `from_name`: Captures the sender's name.
  - `from_email`: Captures the sender's email address.
  - `message`: Captures the content of the message.

### How It Works
1. The form collects user input for `name`, `email`, and `message`.
2. These inputs are passed as parameters to EmailJS through its `send` method.
3. EmailJS processes the data and sends an email based on the configured template.

### Email Configuration Steps
1. **Sign up for EmailJS**:
   - Create an account at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
2. **Create a Service**:
   - In the EmailJS dashboard, set up a service to handle your emails.
3. **Create a Template**:
   - Define a template that uses the `from_name`, `from_email`, and `message` parameters.
4. **Get Your API Keys**:
   - Obtain the `serviceID`, `templateID`, and `publicKey` from the EmailJS dashboard.
5. **Update the Code**:
   - Replace placeholders in the JavaScript code with your actual EmailJS credentials.
